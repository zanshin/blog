# Technology
## Hardware
**Personal**  
[15-inch M2 MacBook Air](https://www.apple.com/macbook-air/ "MacBook Air")  
16 GB RAM and 2TB of storage. This is the best computer I've ever owned--form
factor, software, everything. Fast, quiet, and unbelievably thin.

[12.9-inch
iPadPro](https://everymac.com/systems/apple/ipad/specs/apple-ipad-pro-12-9-inch-4th-gen-a2229-wi-fi-only-specs.html
"iPadPro")  
2.5 GHz A12Z Bionic CPU and 256 GB storage. When my 2013 15-inch MacBook Pro
lost its battery, I used my COVID stimulus check to purchase this iPadPro, and
a Magic Keyboard case for it. It was my primary computer until I got the M2
MacBook Air in 2023.

**Employer**  
[14-inch M2 MacBook Pro]()  
32 GB RAM and 1 TB of storage. 

# Software
**Development**  
[Neovim](https://neovim.io "Neovim")  
I first used `vi` in 1997 and I've been a full-time used of Vim and later
Neovim since 2009. I use it for code, both on personal project and for work.
Some of those projects are tweaking my Neovim [configuration
](https://github.com/zanshin/dotfiles/tree/master/nvim "Neovim configuration") itself.

[Zed](https://zed.dev "Zed")  
Recently I've been trying Zed. The project has open sourced the code, and their
[blog](https://zed.dev/blog "Zed blog") regularly has fascinating deep dives into how the editor is designed and
works.

[tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki "tmux")  
A terminal multiplexer, tmux allows me to have multiple session, with multiple
windows and panes. I use it extensively on remote systems I manage or interact
with. Being able to resume a session at a later time from the same machine or a
different one is a super power. My [tmux
configuration](https://github.com/zanshin/dotfiles/tree/master/tmux "tmux
configuration") is on GitHub.

[Mosh](https://mosh.org "Mosh")  
Mosh is a mobile shell. Even if the connection is momentarily interrupted, mosh
will keep things alive. I use it when I'm working from my iPad Pro, since there
is no guarantee that the application I'm using, Blink, will not be
suspended.

[Blink](https://blink.sh "Blink")  
Blink is my terminal of choice on iPadOS. It comes with Mosh integration
and makes using an iPadPro as a laptop replacement a much better experience.

[Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/ "Bash")  
Except for a couple of years around 2011, I've been using bash as my shell for
longer than I remember. Like Neovim and tmux, I have a
[configuration](https://github.com/zanshin/dotfiles/tree/master/bash "bash
configuration") for bash saved in my dot files repository.

[Starship](https://starship.rs "Starship")  
Starship is a Rust-language prompt that is highly cutomizable. It lets me have
a feature rich prompt without my having to maintain it.

**Terminal**  
[WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/index.html "WezTerm")  
I used iTerm 2 for years. And I've toyed with Alacritty, Kitty, and Warp. But
my currently terminal emulator of choice is WezTerm.

**Hosting**  
[Pair Networks](https://www.pair.com "Pair")  
I used Pair for hosting my website back in the early 2000's but then foolishly
moved away to less expensive options. When WebFaction was absorbed by GoDaddy,
I returned to the fold. 

### Feeds / Social
**RSS**  
[NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com "NetNewsWire")  
I've been using NetNewsWire since 2003? 2004? It's bulletproof and does exactly
what I want and need. I maintain my OPML feed locally rather than use a
3rd-party service.

**Mastodon**  
I used Twitter from 2008-ish until the Musk takeover. I switched to Mastodon
and haven't looked back. You can find me at [@zanshin@hachyderm.io](https://hachyderm.io/@zanshin).

[Ivory](https://tapbots.com/ivory/mac/ "Ivory")  
As soon as I was able to acquire a Test Flight seat for Ivory, it became my
preferred Mastodon client. I use it on my phone, iPad, and MacBook Air daily.

# Music
## Hardware  
**Cellos**  
I have two acoustic and one electric cello.

[Jay Haide model](http://www.jayhaide.com/Cello/Statue-Model-Cello "Statue Model Cello").  
My current cello is a wonderful Jay Haide 4/4 Statue Euro Ruggeri model that I purchased new in 2021.
It has a rich, deep voice, and tremendous power. I'm still learning all the
nuances to its character.

[Hans Stainer 100](https://www.eastmanstrings.com/cello "Hans Stainer 100")  
My first acoustic cello was labeled Hand Stainer 100, but I believe is actually and
Eastman 100. This was the perfect instrument for me to start on. I currently
have it tuned for the Bach 5th Cello suite.

[NS Design NXT
5](https://thinkns.com/instrument/ns-design-electric-cello/ns-design-electric-cello-wav/
"NS Design Cello")  
(The link is to the current model most like mine. NS Design no long sells mine.)
In 2014 I bought a 5-string electric cello from NS Design. It has been a
challenge to play well as the string geometry is just different enough from a
4-string instrument to cause issues. It does have a surprisingly good cello
sound, for something that doesn't have a body.

[CodeBox Diamond
SX](https://www.codabow.com/collections/cello-performance-models/products/diamond-sx-cello
"CodeBow SX")  
I've been playing with this carbon fiber bow for the past 12 or so years.
Someday I'll explore a wooden bow.

**Mandolin**  
[Savanah SA-110](https://amzn.to/450iG8N "Savanah SA-110")  
I bought this oval-hole mandolin from the local music store largely on a whim
in 2019. I've been slowly teaching myself to play. That it is tuned in 5ths,
like my cello, has helped immensely in learning to play it.

## Software
[TonalEnergy Tuner](https://www.tonalenergy.com "Tonal Energy")  
For tuning and metronome I use the Tonal Energy app on my iPhone. It has far
more features than I'll ever use, but it works well, and I like the smiley
faces you get when you are in tune.

[forScore](https://forscore.co "forScore")  
forScore is a digital sheet music app I run on my iPadPro. Under the covers it
is a PDF viewer and editing tool, customized for sheet music. I highly
recommend it.
