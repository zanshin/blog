Zanshin.net is a technology-centric website with occasional forays into aspects of my life outside of computers. I've been publishing at this domain since February 1996, and elsewhere since 1994.

## Publishing
The site is statically generated using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com "Jekyll"). Content is composed for the most part in [Neovim](http://www.neoim.io "Neovim"). Hosting services are provided by [Pair](http://www.pair.com/ "Pair").

The pages are all HTML 5, and the style was originally based on the [Minimal](https://github.com/orderedlist/minimal "Minimal") theme by [Steve Smith](https://github.com/orderedlist "Steve Smith"). The page and post footers, and the pagination style are based on the [Kasper](https://github.com/rosario/kasper "Kasper") theme, which is in turn influenced by the [Ghost](https://ghost.org "Ghost") blogging platform. [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/ "Font Awesome") is used to produce the footer icons. Site statistics are collected by [Mint](http://haveamint.com "Mint").

## Tools
My current computer is a MacBook Pro ([Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013](http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/specs-retina/ "MacBook Pro with Retina Display tech specs")) named Rosindust. I also continue to use my previous computer, a [mid-2009 15-inch MacBook Pro](http://support.apple.com/kb/SP544 "MacBook Pro") called BlackPerl. Both computers are running OS X Yosemite. I also make daily use of an iPhone 5, an iPad Mini, and an iPad Air.

## Fonts
The Google font [Lato](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Lato "Lato") in various weights is used throughout the site.

## Zanshin
(Japanese: 残心)
Zanshin is a term used in the Japanese martial arts. It refers to a state of awareness – of relaxed alertness. The literal translation of zanshin is "remaining mind".
