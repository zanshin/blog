Zanshin.net is a technology-centric website with occasional forays into aspects of my life outside of computers. I've been publishing at this domain since February 1996, and elsewhere since 1994.

## Publishing
The site is statically generated using [Hugo](http://gohugo.io "Hugo"). Content is composed for the most part in [Neovim](http://www.neoim.io "Neovim"). Hosting services are provided by [Pair](http://www.pair.com/ "Pair").

The pages are all HTML 5, and the style was originally based on the [Minimal](https://github.com/orderedlist/minimal "Minimal") theme by [Steve Smith](https://github.com/orderedlist "Steve Smith"). The page and post footers, and the pagination style are based on the [Kasper](https://github.com/rosario/kasper "Kasper") theme, which is in turn influenced by the [Ghost](https://ghost.org "Ghost") blogging platform. [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/ "Font Awesome") is used to produce the footer icons. Site statistics are collected by [Mint](http://haveamint.com "Mint").

## Fonts
The fonts are open source, GDPR compliant fonts from [Bunny Fonts](https://fonts.bunny.net "Bunny
Fonts"). Currently the headings are Cormorant Small Caps, and the body is Gotu.

## Zanshin
(Japanese: 残心)
Zanshin is a term used in the Japanese martial arts. It refers to a state of awareness – of relaxed alertness. The literal translation of zanshin is "remaining mind".
