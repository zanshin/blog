During our trip home we were both shocked at the numbers of people coughing. On our last tour bus we were surrounded by hacking and coughing. At least one woman wasn't even bothering to cover her mouth. On the plane there was more coughing.

I have had a runny nose and slight headache ever since we got home Monday. Yesterday it blossomed into a full-blown cold. Why am I not surprised?
