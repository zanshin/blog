I've been on a [John Sandford](http://www.amazon.com/John-Sandford/e/B000AQ8P4W/ref=ntt_athr_dp_pel_pop_1 "John Sandford") _Prey_ book orgy the past couple of weeks. So far I've read the first six books of the Lucas Davenport series in order, read the most recent book (#22), and I'm listening to yet another on Audio CD.

I've got at least two more audio books from the series and three or four more print books as well. I'll have to haunt the library stacks for the rest. Once I finish the _Prey_ books I'll move on to the _Kidd_ books and then maybe the _Virgil Flowers_ ones. I've read all of these books before so rereading them is like putting on old favorite clothes.
