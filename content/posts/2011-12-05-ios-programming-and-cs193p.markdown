A few weeks ago I read about an iOS programming course offered by Stanford,
called 
[CS193P iPhone Application Development](http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs193p/cgi-bin/drupal/ "CS193P iPhone Application Development") and was intrigued enough to save a link to the material for future reference. At the end of the Thanksgiving holiday weekend as I was preparing for a week long business trip I decided to download the [course through iTunes University](http://itunes.apple.com/us/itunes-u/ipad-iphone-application-development/id473757255 "iTunes link") and give it a try.

It is fantastic. I've watched the first two lectures twice, and have begun
watching the third lecture. The professor, Paul Hegarty, is an outstanding
lecturer. The material is excellent and extremely well presented. The quality of the
videos and lecture slides is top-notch. Not only am I impressed with the
material and its presentation, I am impressed with how quickly I am progressing
through the assignments.

I have no C programming experience (I do have more than 30 years of programming
under my belt, just never C.) and in the few short hours I've devoted to the
course I've already increased my C, and Objective-C, knowledge a hundred-fold.

If you have any interest in learning about iOS programming and Objective-C
I highly recommend this course.
