I've always enjoyed John Sandford's _Prey_ series and I especially like the _Kidd_ books, so I was interested to see what _<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0399153543/sr=8-1/qid=1149994412/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-8820890-2075017?%5Fencoding=UTF8" title="Dead Watch">Dead Watch</a>_, a standalone story, would be like. I wasn't able to put it down.

Rating: The only problem with finishing this in one day is that I have nothing to read tomorrow.
