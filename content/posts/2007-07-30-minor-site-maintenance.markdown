I've cleaned up the footer presentation by removing the links to two older forms of the syndication feed.  The only feed I am currently supporting is the 2.0 specification.  Also, I fixed a display error where the footer was displaying outside of the page boundaries on individual posting pages.

Boring stuff, but necessary.
