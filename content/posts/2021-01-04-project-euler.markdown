In an effort to improve my understanding of the [Go](https://golang.org "Go") programming language, I've start working the problems described on the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net "Project Euler") website. Over the past weekend I was able to complete
problems 1 through 4.

Solving these kind of problems programmatically has been good challenge for me. It has been a long
time since I exercised that part of my brain that makes me a good programmer.

So far I have solved these problems:

* [Multiples of 3 and 5](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1 "Multiples of 3 and 5")
* [Even Fibonacci Numbers](https://projecteuler.net/problem=2 "Even Fibonacci Numbers")
* [Largest Prime Factor](https://projecteuler.net/problem=3 "Largest Prime Factor")
* [Largest Palindrome Product](https://projecteuler.net/problem=4 "Largest Palindrome Product")

The first 100 problems are considered easy and there are over 700 in total. I won't be running out
of coding problems any time soon.
