Over the weekend I pushed a new version of [zanshin.net](https://zanshin.net "Zanshin.net") out into the wild. I've been wanting to redesign my site for a while now and I'm quite pleased with the new leaner look of things. In addition to a new theme I've switched from using [Octopress](http://octopress.org "Octopress") to using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com "Jekyll") to drive the generation of the site. I'm working on a posting that will detail what it took to revamp the site.

If you find anything amiss please let me know via the email icon over in the socail media icon row in the sidebar.
