When _Hunger Games_ was first released the University were I work selected it as the first book for everyone on campus to read over the summer. The idea was we'd all have a similar experience to share. I avoided the book then but now with the movie out and capturing lots of press I thought I'd give it a try. That our New York City hotel is directly across the street from a theater showing the movie helped. It's a compelling story in a rather simple and direct way. Because it's primarily aimed at the teen aged reader it makes for a quick read. I'm already into book two of the trilogy after just a day of reading. It's not great literature but it isn't bad either.
