_The First Rule_ is the second Joe Pike book the Robert Crais has written. While Elvis Cole plays a minor role in the story it really centers on Pike. The the Elvis Cole series, this book was quick-paced and easy to consume in a couple of sittings. After years of only seeing the still surface of Pike's character, it is interesting to finally get to plumb his depths.
