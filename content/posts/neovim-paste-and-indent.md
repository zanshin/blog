Today I learned that you can paste *and* match surrounding indentation at once. After selecting the
line or block of lines to be pasted, use `]p` instead of only `p`. Et voila.

I am embarrassed to think of the hundreds, thousands of copy-paste operations I've done that were
immediately followed by selecting the newly pasted block and fixing its indentation. I need the read
the friendly manual more.
