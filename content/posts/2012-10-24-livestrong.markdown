On [app.net](https://join.app.net) (the alternate Twitter) someone posted a link to this [AlJazeera](http://www.aljazeera.com "AlJazeera") editorial, [Lance Armstrong: A Cheater? Five reasons why we don't care](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2012/10/201210236357172286.html "Lance Armstrong: A Cheater? Five reasons why we don't care"). It more or less says what I think about the whole Lance Armstrong thing.


I wear the LiveSTRONG band to remind me of Amy, and Helen, and Michele, and Riley. Not that I need reminding but in some way it focuses me on the positives their lives brought to mine, and helps me past the hole their various cancers left in my soul.

Maybe we should allow performance enhancing drugs and treatments in sports. I'm sure there is example after example of training methods and techniques that are legitimate in today's competitions that were illegal in years gone by. 

I'm sorry that his reputation and efforts are now being smeared. And I am saddened by the amount of schadenfreude some news agencies and bloggers are displaying. It seems the we as a society delight in making heroes only slightly more than we delight in tearing them down.

Finally, all of this reminds me of my favorite quote, from Theodore Roosevelt:

>"It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat."
