While a lot of memories of my mother bring some tears with them, some are good.  Occasionally they bring a smile or laughter.  Yesterday was one of those good memory days.

<strong>Some background</strong>
When the Beatles <em>Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</em> album was released it caused quite a stir in the press.  Enough so that my mom talked about it to my father.  As a joke he bought her the album.  She liked the music enough to go out and purchase the other Beatles' albums; meaning I grew up with a combination of opera and the Beatles.

She also, like the rest of us, refused to listen to some songs as they would get stuck in her head.

Finally, she appreciated the <em><a href="https://zanshin.net/wp-admin/;http://www.arcamax.com/zits%22" title="Zits">Zits</a></em> comic strip.

<strong>With all that in mind...</strong>
I give you the November 13, 2007 <em>Zits</em> comic strip.
