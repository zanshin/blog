For many years now I have been using [Liquidprompt](https://github.com/nojhan/liquidprompt
"Liquidprompt") to create and populate my bash shell prompt. Prior to discovering Liquidprompt, I
had a hand-rolled prompt that did some of what I wanted.

I've now switched to using [Starship](https://starship.rs "Starship") for my prompt. In particular I
like the [bracketed segments](https://starship.rs/presets/bracketed-segments.html "bracketed
segments") preset.

So far I've only switched on my personal computer. If by the end of the Thanksgiving break I'm still
liking Starship, I'll set it up on work computer.
