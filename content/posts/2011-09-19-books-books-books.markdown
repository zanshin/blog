Ever since I was a small child I've had a love affair with books. Both of
my parents read out loud to me from the time I was a small boy. One of
my proudest moments as a child was getting my own library card and being
able to checkout books from the library.

I read every day and I like to make lists, so I've added a page devoted
entirely to [books]({{ root_url }}/books "Books") here on zanshin.net.
The page uses a nifty [Amazon Web Service](https://zanshin.net/2011/08/24/amazon-plugin-for-octopress/ "Amazon Plugin for Octopress") to grab the cover image of a
book using just the Amazon identifier. And the [Liquid tags](http://wiki.shopify.com/UsingLiquid "Liquid tags") used by
[Octopress](http://octopress.org "Octopress") allowed me to build the page with just 12 lines of code. This
makes both the nerd in me, and the book lover in me, very happy.
