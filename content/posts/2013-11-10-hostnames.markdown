A wonderful resource to get you started with hostnames. For a time I used locations from "The Lord of the Rings" books. I once worked at a place that used rivers (test machines) and planets (production machines). I think you could make good use of the periodic table of elements too. Maybe use the atomic weight as the final part of the IP address.
