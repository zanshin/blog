In the winter of 2000-2001 I developed a heel spur on my left heel. Over the
course of the spring and early summer, though a series of ultrasound
treatments, the calcification was reduced. Almost immediately I developed
similar pain on my right heel, and had it treated the same way.

In late 2005 I started to develop pain my in right big toe and, when
I complained to my chiropractor, she pointed out that I have fallen arches. The
plantar fascia, the connective tissue connecting the heel and toes, is under
different tension as a result of the fallen arch and she felt this was the
cause of my pain. It also seemed to explain the earlier heel spurs.

Two primary care physicians and a second chiropractor have not bee successful
in finding a solution to the near daily pain this joint experiences. I liken it
to have just smacked my toe into a wall, or maybe dropping a sledge hammer on
it. There have been times at night when the pain has woken me up. Nighttime
seems to be the worst time for my toe, even the weight of the sheet on it is
uncomfortable. I've learned to sleep with my foot partial extended over the
side of the bed so as to suspend my toe in the air with nothing against it.

As a result of our primary care physician moving away I saw a new doctor today,
ostensibly about my right knee, I was given a new diagnosis for my toe:
[gout](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gout "Gout").
In collecting information about my overall health the doctor zeroed in on
several things I said about my toe and how it reacts to different situations.
She x-rayed it, along with my knee, and said there were some odd calcifications
present, that, along with the pain I described, point to gout as the cause. I'm
signed up for a well-man physical at the end of December, which includes
a blood test. This test will include a test for uric acid, which will help to
determine for certain that I have this form of inflammatory arthritis.
Historically gout was known as the "disease of kings" or a "rich man's disease"
- I guess due to the diet or lifestyle which can cause the condition. 

Once I've had the blood work completed I suspect there will be some dietary
suggestions made and maybe some medicine to correct or combat the uric acid
levels in my body.

As for my knee, which is been creaky for years and twinging at times, the
doctor feels that an MRI to better see what shape the soft tissues of that
joint are in, is called for. I'm waiting for that exam to be scheduled. If
there is enough damaged tissue, she'll recommend I see and orthopedist for
further treatment and or surgery. If the damage doesn't warrant something
invasive, we'll try some physical therapy. 

While I was still actively pursuing martial arts I managed to tear the upper
anchor of my medial collateral ligament (MCL), which heals itself. On the x-ray
there is a calcification where the bone and ligament meet. She see some slight
indications of arthritis in my knee, but nothing significant. The MRI will
allow better imaging of the tendons and ligaments, as well as the [meniscus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meniscus_\(anatomy\) "Meniscus") in that joint.
