In my ongoing effort to find an exercise routine that I (a) like and (b)
am willing to incorportate into my daily life, I am now going swimming.

Last winter I bought a magnetic trainer and rode my bicycle on it some,
but not regularly and not enough to make a difference in my weight. Over
the summer it was too hot to even think about exercise, much less do
any.

As a univeristy employee I get access to the rec center and to the
natatorium. Yesterday I signed up for three months of pool access and
today at 5 pm is the first public swim session available to me. I
haven't been swimming in seven years and I've never used swimming as a
form of exercise. 

Hopefully twice-a-week swim sessions will take hold and grow into a
habit. And, if nothing else, I've got a great Peter Gabriel song running
in my head now as a result of the title for this posting.
