Google has released a patch that addresses a potential data leak issue. The real question is, how long will it take the various carriers to push the patch to their customers.

Update: Turns out it's a <a title="Google Android Fix" href="http://blogs.computerworld.com/18308/google_android_security_flaw">server side fix</a> and will roll out over the next few days. The carriers and their customers need do nothing. Plus one for Google.
