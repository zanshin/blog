Six years ago in early July 2006 I joined eHarmony hoping to find someone to spend my life with. I wasn't at all sure it would work but I was determined to try. 

Six years ago today I received the following email at 6:31 am in the morning.

>Dear Mark and Sibylle,
>
>eHarmony's Compatibility Matching System has found that you two are a highly compatible match, based on our rigorous 29 Dimensions scale. With this level of compatibility, we believe you two will have a lot to talk about and may even find true love together.
>
>So, Mark and Sibylle, we'd like to make an introduction.
>
>Sibylle lives in Manhattan, Kansas United States.
>Mark lives in Overland Park, Kansas United States.
>
>The next step, Mark, is for you to begin communicating with Sibylle. Explore your shared areas of compatibility, and have fun discovering if there's chemistry.
>
>Remember, your match has been carefully selected from millions of candidates because you share extraordinary levels of compatibility in the areas proven to create relationship success. So we encourage you to consider this match with care and find out what lies beyond your summary profiles.
>
>The next step is simpleâ€”just begin communicating today!
>
>Sincerely,
>
>Dr. Neil Clark Warren 
>Founder, eHarmony.com

At the time I didn't know that Sibylle would become my companion, lover, best friend, partner, and wife. We moved through the first questions and then "must have's and can't stands" followed by second questions and finally to sharing messages through eHarmony. Within a week we were emailing each other multiple times a day. In the three weeks between our introduction and when we first met in person on August 12th, we sent over 400 emails.

In the intervening six years we have lived together, traveled together, moved together, and grown together. We are very fortunate to have each other, to have the relationship that we share. 

Yes, we are an eHarmony success story. More importantly we are our own success story.
