I ran across an interesting turn of phrase in a book I'm currently reading. The story takes place in Japan, and the prose is littered with bits of Japanese. The phrase _mono no aware_ was translated as "the sadness of being human."

Given all that has transpired in the last year and a half, this struck a rather deep cord with me. I'm not sure exactly what it means, but I can't get it out of my head. Maybe I'll figure it out eventually, but for now, I am finding some comfort in _mono no aware_
