When _<a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0182789/" title="Bicentennial Man">Bicentennial Man</a>_ first came out it was a bit of a sleeper, it wasn't until I rented it and watched that I realized what a good movie it actually was. Robin Williams shines as a robot seeking humanity. Poignant and moving, this movies is one of my favorites.

Rating: Excellent from start to finish
