The colophon has been updated for the first time in a year, and I've removed the script that displayed random titles on the home page.  Henceforth the only title will be, "zanshin.net: because not enough sites start with the letter Z."

Also, I've been cleaning up the tag order on some of the ancillary pages, putting the footer inside the page container where it belongs.
