The first operating system I installed on my first PC-style computer was OS/2 2.1. The company I worked for at the time was using OS/2 with a case tool called ADW, so I was familar with it and wanted to use it at home too. Eventaully it became too cumbersome to continue using and I switched to Windows for Workgroups (3.11). I knew some of the details in this article but not all. It's a fascinating look at the early days of personal computing.
