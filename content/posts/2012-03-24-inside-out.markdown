Over the years I have enjoyed Barry Eisler's _John Rain_ series. _Inside Out_ is the second in a new series with very (so far) tenuous ties to the John Rain books. Eisler's background as a covert operative for the CIA adds a lot of verisimilitude to his books and _Inside Out_ is no exception. A good, quick, vacation read.
