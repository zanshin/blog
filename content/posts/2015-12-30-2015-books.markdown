I read or listened to a total of [123 books](http://books.zanshin.net "Books") in 2015. 40 were brand new to me, the other 83 were rereads or re-listens.

The longest book was Neal Stephenson's "<a rel="nofollow" href="http://amzn.to/2vQCygv">Seveneves: A Novel</a>" at 880 pages.

The shortest was "<a rel="nofollow" href="http://amzn.to/2uRe3vk">The Countess of Stanlein Restored: A History of the Countess of Stanlein Ex Paganini Stradivarius Cello of 1707</a>", a history of a Stradivarius cello at 120 pages.

In total I read 39,160 pages, or 108 pages a day average for the year.

17 of the titles on my list were audio books. The longest of these was (again) a Neal Stephenson book, "<a rel="nofollow" href="http://amzn.to/2fBlNzm">Reamde</a>" at 38 hours and 34 minutes.

The shortest audiobook was a mere 9 hours; "<a rel="nofollow" href="http://amzn.to/2vtcmHW">The Hanged Man's Song</a>" by John Sandford.

In total I listened to 249 hours and 41 minutes of audio books this year. Which works out to 41 minutes per day average.

Ten of the books were non-fiction, eight were science fiction, one was historical fiction, and the rest fiction. Thirty-one of the books were from our local public library, the rest I own in one format or another.

Out of all the books I read or listened to this year, Andy Weir's "<a rel="nofollow" href="http://amzn.to/2vQh3wv">The Martian</a>" was far and away my favortie book. Not only did I read it multiple times, I listened to the audio version. And I saw it in the theater when it came out. And I bought a copy on iTunes that I've now watched twice in a row. It's easily one of the very best books I've read in a long, long time.
