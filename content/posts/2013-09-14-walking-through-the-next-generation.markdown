Part of my current lifestyle hack is walking. We bought a treadmill last year and since early this
spring I've been walking 5 or 6 days a week on it. I've been using __Star Trek: The Next
Generation__ episodes as entertainment while I walk. Each episode is 45 minutes long and there are
178 episodes total. At a walking pace of 3 miles per hour I get 2.25 miles in for each episode. I'm
almost through season 5 now. By the time I finish the series I'll have 400 miles accumulated. 

Of course then I'll have to start __Deep Space Nine__, followed by __Voyager__ and then
__Enterprise__.
