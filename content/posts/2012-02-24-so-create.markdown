Here's a great quote that I just ran across in this [wonderful rant about Rails](http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.in/2012/02/rails-went-off-rails-why-im-rebuilding.html "Rails when off the rails"). The quote is by [why the lucky stiff](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff "_why").

> when you donâ€™t create things, you become defined by your tastes rather than ability. your tastes only narrow & exclude people. so create.
