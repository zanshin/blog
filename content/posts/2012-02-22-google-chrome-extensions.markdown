I've been using Google Chrome as my primary browser for quite some time now. I especially like that the address bar is also the search box. Dozens if not hundreds of times a day I Cmd-Tab to Chrome, Cmd-T to open a new tab, and type in a search term to look something up. Not having to move the insertion point to a separate search field is fabulous.

I've slowly added new extension to Chrome to improve its usefulness to me. Here is the current set I'm using.

##Web Developer  
[Web Developer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bfbameneiokkgbdmiekhjnmfkcnldhhm "Web Developer") is the official port of the Firefox Web Developer extension. I don't use it much, but there are times that it is invaluable. 

##1Password  
[1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword "1Password") is my password manager of choice. The extension allows me to access secure sites with a simple shortcut. 

##Clip to Evernote  
The [Evernote](http://evernote.com "Evernote") extension allows me to capture URLs, clip portions of, or entire web pages. I used to clutter my bookmarks with things I didn't want to lose track of, and now all that stuff goes into Evernote.

##Xmarks Synchronizer  
I'm relatively new to using [Xmarks](http://www.xmarks.com/ "Xmarks"). I was using Chrome's internal synchronization feature but increasingly the syncs weren't happening so I switched. The added bonus is synchronization across browsers, so Safari on my Mac is up-to-date and, through iCloud, my iPad and iPhone as well.

##Tabs Counter  
Other than being nerdy, [Tabs Counter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ibokmmioadhomkeikgbfenloopldkcoi "Tabs Counter") is useless. Still, it is nice to know how many tabs are open at any one time. 

##Ghostery  
The newest of my extensions, [Ghostery](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mlomiejdfkolichcflejclcbmpeaniij "Ghostery") shows the tracking services embedded in the current page.
