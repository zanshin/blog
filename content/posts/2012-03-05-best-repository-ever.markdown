Two times now in the past few days I have wiped out a hard drive and started over by reinstalling the operating system and all the applications and settings I wanted. Both times I benefited hugely thanks to a small Github repository I created for myself.

That repository holds many of the configuration files that some of my software tools use, the so-called "dotfiles". With a simple `git clone` command followed by a couple of `ln -s` commands to link the files into place I was able to recreate my zsh environment, setup my global Git configuration and ignore files, configure Vim, and load my TextMate 2 properties. 

Originally I created the [dotfile repository](https://github.com/zan5hin/dotfiles "dotfiles") as an exercise in being nerdy. After this past weekend that exercise has more than paid for itself.
