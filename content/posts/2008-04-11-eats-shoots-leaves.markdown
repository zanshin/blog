Kansas City employs digital information signs on the Interstate highways that traverse and circumnavigate the city, which usually display travel times to major intersections or landmarks.  Very useful for regular commuters making their daily trek to or from work.  In the summertime these signs display information about ozone alerts, and, when necessary, there are Amber alerts or accident reports displayed.  For the past two weeks a new message has graced several of the signs I go past on my daily commute.  A message which reads
<blockquote>Aggressive Driving Enforcement, April 1 - 15</blockquote>
Honest.  I'm sure that everyone translates this properly in their head to mean, aggressive driving will be ticketed and not the written meaning.  Still, I think a better phrase would be
<blockquote>Aggressive Driving Ticketing, April 1 - 15</blockquote>
