_Trust Your Eyes_ is the first book by Linwood Barclay I've ever read. It won't be the last. Filled with plots twists and turns, including a startling revelation in the very last paragraph, I thoroughly enjoyed _Trust Your Eyes_. 

I'll be working my way through his eleven other books just a quickly as I can get them.
