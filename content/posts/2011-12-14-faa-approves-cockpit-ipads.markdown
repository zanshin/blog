I'm one of those people who doesn't turn anything off when I fly. I do set my phone to "airplane" mode, mostly so it doesn't make any noise that would get me in dutch with the flight attendents. No electronics until 10000 feet is a silly rule. But if that's the price we have to pay to not have cellphone call usage during a flight, I'll gladly pay it.
