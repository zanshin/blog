In the process of learning Go language programming I have consumed a lot of written and visual
material. Today I listened to a few minutes of the Go Time podcast, where they were talking about
documentation. The introduction to the episode really resonated with me, and so I wanted to capture
it in my words here.

## Tutorials
When first starting a new topic, particularly a technical one like, say Go programming, tutorials
are a common starting point. Explanation mixed with samples, something you can follow along with at
home. Learning my mimicking.

## How To
How to resources are aimed at solving a particular problem. How to I set up an HTTP router in Go?,
or How should a go project be structured? A how to is more narrowly focused. It aims to impart
knowledge about this one specific topic.

## Articles or Presentations
Somewhat broader in scope than a how to, an article or presentation (i.e., at a conference) dive a
bit deeper into a topic. It isn't a tutorial, assumptions are usually made about what you already
know. And it isn't a focused as a how to. It adds some though process to the solution or technique
discussed.

## Documentation
Documentation is a dictionary. An reference. You are looking up the specifics of an API or library.
Depending on the maturity of the documentation, and whether it includes examples or not, finding
information in the documentation can be difficult. If you know the package or library you need and
only need to refresh your understanding of it's parameters and return value, documentation is
fantastic. If you are unsure, and are hunting for the right tool, documentation can be frustrating.

## The Arc of Learning
In the course of learning a new programming language, I move through all of these categories of
documentation. While working through a tutorial I may digress into a how to or look up things in the
documentation. Generally though, I move from tutorials through how to and articles, and finally to
documentation.
