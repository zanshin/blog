Once upon a time, a long time ago, in a land far, far away I worked for a YMCA summer camp. In a week's time I could teach 8-10 eight year olds the following:

One hen  
Two ducks  
Three squawking geese  
Four limerick oysters  
Five corpulent porpoises  
Six pairs of Don Alverzo's tweezers  
Seven thousand Macedonians in full battle array  
Eight brass monkeys from the ancient sacred crypts of Egypt  
Nine sympathetic, apathetic, diabetic old men on roller skates with a marked propensity toward procrastination and sloth  
and  
Ten lyrical, spherical denizens of the deep, who haul quay around the corner, and quiver all at the same time  

Then I'd send them home with mom or dad with instructions to teach them the same verse. I just thought you should know.
