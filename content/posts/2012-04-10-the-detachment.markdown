_The Detachment_ merges the two story lines Barry Eisler has created into a single storyline. The venerable John Rain mets up with and works with Ben Treven and Daniel Larison, along with his cohort Dox. Eisler isn't shy about sharing his opinions through his stories. With his CIA background you have to wonder what is fiction and what is fact sometimes. _The Detachment_ flirted with being a little unbelievable at times, but is still a good read. Here's hoping the next Eisler novel explores Dox's background, and maybe gets him a full name.
