I voted for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz for President and Vice-President. 

Even if I didn't appreciate the policies and promises the Harris/Walz campaign is
    espousing, I would have cast my ballot for them. The alternative is a
    fascist, hate-filled, twice impeached, serial rapist, and convicted felon, who 
    is surrounded by a circle of sycophantic enablers who view him as a means
    to unchecked power--for themselves, and who view ordinary people as serfs
    who should be grateful for any table scraps that fall their way.

I voted for Kamala Harris because I want the vision of America that has lasted
for 248 years to continue. 

I voted for Kamala Harris because I want our democracy to continue. 

I voted for Kamala Harris because I happen to think she will be an incredible President. 

I voted for Kamala Harris because I don't want to live in a fascist
dictatorship that hearkens back to Nazism.

I sincerely hope that you have, or will, vote for hope, equality, democracy,
decency, and the promise of what American can be. 

I hope you vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.
