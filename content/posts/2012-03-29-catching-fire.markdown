_Catching Fire_ was a tad more introspective in a seventeen-going-on-eighteen kind of way. One of my least favorite plot ploys is the angst-filled character who through misunderstanding, lack of communication, and self-doubt manages to keep the tension in the story ramped up. This series wasn't the worst example of that kind of writing, but it was present.
