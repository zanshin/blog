I recently added _<a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0327137/" title="Secondhand Lions">Secondhand Lions</a>_ to my collection of DVDs. Michele and I first saw this gem in the theater and I have wanted a copy ever since. While it doesn't add anything to the boy coming of age story, it is beautifully acted and staged. We could all do with uncles like Garth and Hub.

Rating: Fun for everyone
