I've known about the annual [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com "Advent of Code") challenge for
several years. I decided to participate this year; I've been slowly teaching myself the Go
programming language and this would be a good way to reinforce what I know. Or to discover what I
don't know.

My bachelor's degree is in "Applied Computer Science". I was in college from 1979 until 1983. While
algorithms may have been discussed in a couple of courses, I did not have a course specifically
about algorithms. I graduated with a college level understanding of COBOL, JCL, VSAM, IMS, and CICS.
The next decade was spent honing my use of those tools.

The problem domains I worked in were centered around batch processing of transactions, we weren't
looking for the speediest way, or the most memory efficient way, or the least costly way to solve
problems. We wanted reliable, durable, functional code to generate bills, update accounts, and
manage assets. We wanted code that was easy to understand and work with at 3 am when your pager went
off.

Fast forward 40 years to the Advent of Code, or as I am calling it in my head, the Algorithm of Code
challenge. So far I've completed the first three days puzzles; 6 puzzles total. My solutions produce
the correct answers, but they are not elegant or pretty. My approach is somewhat brute force.
Effective? Yes, but I'm convinced that someone with a better grasp of algorithms would be able to solve
these challenges with fewer lines of code, perhaps more efficiently.

Going forward I plan to alter my approach to solving the puzzles. If I realize that I need to find
the intersection between three sets, I'll search for "algorithm to find intersection between sets"
and try to incorporate what I find into my solution. Once I have a feel for the crux of the problem,
I'll research to see if there is some known algorithm useful in overcoming that hurdle.

A couple months ago I discovered that [FrontendMasters](https://frontendmasters.com
"FrontendMasters") is offering a free [algorithms](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/
"The Last Algorithm Course You'll Need") course. I started to watch the first lesson, but
life intruded and I haven't continued. Over the extended year end break I want to try to complete
the algorithm course to gain a better understanding of what they are an how to utilize them.

In the meantime, I'll be plugging away at the next set of puzzles, and hoping to learn a bit more
about programming.
