The [Uses This](http://usesthis.com "Uses This") series, and Shawn Blanc's [Sweet Mac Setups](http://shawnblanc.net/sweet-mac-setups/ "Sweet Mac Setups") series have always intrigued me, so I decided to write one of my own.

##Who are you and what do you do?
My name is Mark Nichols. I'm married to [Sibylle Kuder](http://sibyllekuder.com "Sibylle Kuder Piano Studio"), I play [violoncello](http://cello.zanshin.net "Solfège"), I hack around with [various computer technologies](http://github/com/zan5hin "My GitHub"), and I'm an all-around good guy. Professionally I work for Kansas State University as an "Integration Services Coordinator" — dealing with the sometimes messy intersection of differing systems and their needs. Lately I've been diving into the world of [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com "Vagrant") and [Chef](http://www.opscode.com/chef/ "Chef").

##What hardware do you use?
My personal computer is a mid-2009 [15" 2009 MacBook Pro](http://support.apple.com/kb/SP544?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US "15-inch Mid 2009") with a 2.66 GHz Core 2 Duo processor and 8 GB of RAM. Within the next week the original 320 GB hard drive will be replaced with a new 1 TB drive.

I also have a [16GB iPad Mini](http://www.apple.com/ipad-mini/overview/ "iPad Mini") that is easily one of the nicest computers I have ever owned. My phone is a [16GB iPhone 5](http://www.apple.com/iphone/ "iPhone") on AT&T.

My employer provides me with wonderful tools, so I have on my desk a [mid-2010 27" iMac](http://support.apple.com/kb/SP588 "27-inch iMac") with a 256GB SSD and a 1 TB spinning drive. My work laptop is a [13" Retina MacBook Pro](http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/ "13-inch MacBook Pro"), with a 500 GB SSD and 8 GB of RAM. It *is* the sweetest computer I've ever had the pleasure of using. 

Tunes in my car are provided via an 8 GB [6th-generation iPod Nano](http://www.apple.com/support/ipodnano/6th_generation/ "iPod Nano"). The car, a 2010 Honda Insight, has the world's clunkiest iPod interface, but it does let me listen to [Zoë Keating](http://www.zoekeating.com "Zoë Keating") on my way to and from work. I have an aging (no longer holds a charge but works fine plugged in) [30 GB iPod](http://www.apple.com/support/ipod/earlier/ "iPod") that holds most of my music and lives in the corner of the house where I practice my cello, so that I can listen to the pieces I am learning.

My cello is a Hans Stainer 100, made by Eastman, fitted with [Jargar Strings](http://www.jargar-strings.com "Jargar Strings") and played with a [CodaBow Diamond SX bow](http://www.codabow.com/cello_sx.html "CodaBow Diamond SX"). I use [Gustave Bernardel rosin](http://www.amazon.com/The-Original-Bernadel-Rosin-Violin/dp/B000F3HK78 "Gustave Bernardel rosin"). 

For printing we have a newly purchased [HP OfficeJet Pro 8600 All-in-One](http://www.amazon.com/HP-Officejet-Wireless-Printer-Scanner/dp/B005O55U2Y/ref=sr_1_cc_2?s=aps&ie=UTF8&qid=1365305141&sr=1-2-catcorr&keywords=hp8600 "HP OfficeJet Pro 8600") printer/copier/fax/scanner. It's beautiful, it's wireless, and it prints like a dream.

At work I use a pair of [Apple EarPods](http://store.apple.com/us/product/MD827LL/A/apple-earpods-with-remote-and-mic?fnode=49 "EarPods") to listen to music or videos. At home I use a variety of earbud style earphones, but only when the cat isn't around. She considers them string with which to be toyed.

##And what software?
[Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com "Sublime Text"), [Vim](http://www.vim.org "Vim"), [tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net "tmux"), and [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home "iTerm2") for most coding. [IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/ "IntelliJ IDEA") for Java, and [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/ "XCode") for Cocoa and iOS development.

[Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/ "Safari") for 99% of my browsing and [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/ "Google Chrome") on rare occasion. 

[Adium](http://adium.im "Adium") for instant message chat and IRC. [Twitterrific](http://twitterrific.com/mac "Twitterrific") for Twitter. 

[Fetch](http://fetchsoftworks.com "Fetch") handles my SFTP needs, although I am making more and more use of sshfs for accessing remote drives.

[Growl](http://growl.info "Growl") for notifications and [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com "Alfred") for Cmd-Space-ing things.

[TakeFive](http://takefiveapp.com "TakFive") helps me to control what's playing, and [Cobook](https://cobook.co "Cobook") gives me access to my contacts. 

[F.Lux](http://stereopsis.com/flux/ "F.Lux") dims my laptop screen at night, and brightens it during the daylight hours. 

[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com "Dropbox") for convenient movement of files between computers, and Git for version control of all my coding projects. 

##What would be your dream setup?
After spending a couple weeks with the 13" Retina MacBook Pro I would be hard pressed to consider any other machine. Well, maybe the 15" Retina MacBook Pro. 

I'd like a dead simple storage system that hung off our router that would let Sibylle backup her Windows-based machines and me back up my OS X-based machines seamlessly. And perhaps a Mac Mini tied to a couple large drives to house all our music and DVD movies.

I'd also like an iPod Classic as it would be large enough to hold my complete collection of music and audio books. But first I'll need a car with a decent iPod interface.

I'm intrigued by the [Sonos Speaker](http://www.sonos.com/shop/products/play3 "Sonos") systems, but other priorities have kept that on the someday list.

And someday I hope to be advanced enough on the cello to warrant a really good, old, instrument.
