##Introduction and Motivation

This is a four-part series on dual booting a MacBook Pro with Arch Linux and Mac OS X. [Part One]({{ site.url }}/2015/02/05/arch-linux-on-a-macbook-pro-part-1-creating-a-usb-installer "Arch Linux on a MacBook Pro Part 1 - Creating a USB Installer") covers creating a bootable USB drive with the Arch Linux installer. [Part Two]({{ site.url }}/2015/02/05/arch-linux-on-a-macbook-pro-part-2-preparing-for-dual-boot "Arch Linux on a MacBook Pro Part 2 - Preparing for Dual Boot") discusses how to prepare the MacBook Pro. Installing the base Arch Linux operating system and getting the dual boot between Arch and OS X working is covered in [Part Three]({{ site.url }}/arch-linux-on-a-macbook-pro-part-3-base-installation "Arch Linux on a MacBook Pro Part 3 - Base Installation"). Setting up the system, configuring Xorg, installing Gnome and Awesome are all covered in [Part Four]({{ site.url }}/arch-linux-on-a-macbook-pro-part-4-system-configuration "Arch Linux on a MacBook Pro Part 4 - System Configuration").

My day job has transitioned to system administration and infrastructure automation ([Chef!](http://chef.io "Chef")). All of our virtual infrastructure (with rare exceptions) is based on Linux so I am keenly interested in learning more about its underpinnings. Setting up Arch Linux and sorting through its configuration challenges seems like a good way to jump into the deep end of the Linux pool.
