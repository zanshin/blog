Recently I have been enjoying several recurring email newsletters. Several are weekly and a couple are monthly. Unlike a website, where I have to remember to periodically go look for fresh content, these come to me. Also, they all aggregate multiple stories around their topic into one convenient place for me.

**Ray's Monthly Newsletter**  
Ray Wenderlich's newsletter is iOS centric, and is an excellent companion to his website, [raywenderlich.com](http://raywenderlich.com  "Ray Wenderlich - Tutorials for iPhone / iOS Development and Gamers"). Lots of tutorials and iOS centered articles.

**Ruby Weekly**  
A weekly roundup of Ruby specific events, reading, libraries and code, tools, and some featured articles. [Ruby Weekly](http://rubyweekly.com "Ruby Weekly") always has something I find interesting.

**iOS Dev Weekly**  
Dave Verwer publishes [iOS Dev Weekly](http://iosdevweekly.com "iOS Dev Weekly") every Friday. It's a well curated list of articles, tools, code, and design links all centered around iOS development.

**Pycoders Weekly**  
[Pycoders Weekly](http://www.pycoders.com "Pycoder's Weekly") is to Python what Ruby Weekly is to Ruby. A weekly listing of news, jobs, projects, and discussions.

**Devops Weekly**  
I've only recently started working in the devops area, and I find that [Devops Weekly](http://devopsweekly.com "Devops Weekly") helps me to learn more about this exciting new convergence between traditional operations and development.

**The Bot Cave**  
Published by [thoughtbot](http://thoughtbot.com "thoughtbot"), [The Bot Cave](http://tinyletter.com/thoughtbot "the bot cave") contains the current state of their research, a first look at new techniques and tools. It's published monthly.

**Lincoln Loop Django Roundup**  
The [Lincoln Loop Django Roundup](http://lincolnloop.com/launchpad/ "Django Roundup") is a low-traffic newsletter with links to Django content, exclusive access to blogs and screencasts, and discounts on Django learning material. 

**Postgres Weekly**  
[Postges Weekly](http://postgresweekly.com "Postgres Weekly") focuses on PostgreSQL articles and news.
