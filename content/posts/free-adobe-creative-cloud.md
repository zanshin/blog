I work for a state university. Through some new licensing agreement, all faculty and staff now have
access to Adobe Creative Cloud for free. This is not as good a deal as it sounds on the surface, at
least not for me.

# Work vs. Personal
I have worked hard since the start of the pandemic, and the beginning of full time remote work for
me, to separate my personal computing from my work computing. My work computer, a 14-inch MacBook
Pro, has nothing personal on it. No personal mail, pictures, files, documents, or music. It's their
computer, it has remote management software on it, and I want to be able to hand it in at a moment's
notice without needing to "clean" it.

My personal computing devices (laptop, phone, tablets) do not have any work-related resources on
them, with the exception of my phone. My laptop and iPads do not have any work related items at all.
At most I (rarely) access work email via the webmail interface.

My iPhone does, unfortunately, have some work related apps and configurations. I have Outlook,
Teams, PagerDuty, and CheckMk apps installed. I'm on several on-call rotations, and that requires I
have these apps installed. I'm using Outlook for my work email, so that the regular mail app only
has my email accounts configured.
