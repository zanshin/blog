Ok.

So once again I'm behind the  curve on automating some part of my webblog. After allowing link rot to infest my <a href="https://zanshin.net/links.php" title="links by del.icio.us">links</a> page for far too long I've upgraded it to use <a href="http://del.icio.us" title="del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a>. I'm sure I'll be tweaking the list for some time but at least all the links work again, and they are all site I visit on a daily (if not more frequent) basis.
