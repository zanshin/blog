With a new 2016 MINI Cooper S making its way to me I've been thinking a lot about cars lately. The Cooper S has a reputation for being quick and nimble. It boasts a sub-seven second zero-to-sixty time. I was curious how the MINI compared to the other cars I've owned. Some Internet searching and a spreadsheet later and I had my answer.

With the exception of the 2001 Lexus LS 430, the MINI Cooper S has the best power-to-weight ratio of any car I've owned. The 430 had a monster 4.3 liter engine, more than twice the size of the MINI's 2 liter engine, but it's also roughly 1200 pounds heavier. I think the MINI will feel faster, and it'll certainly corner better. 

The best power-to-weight ratio vehicle I've ever owned was a 1987 Suzuki Katana 1100F. With a dry weight of 537 pounds and 136 horsepower, it's ratio is 3.95 pounds-per-horsepower. Incredibly fast with instant acceleration at any speed. Not much fun in the winter though, and no room for a cello.
