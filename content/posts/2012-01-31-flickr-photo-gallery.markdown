A couple of years ago I set up a Flickr photo gallery on Sibylle's [studio site](http://sibyllekuder.com "Elfenbein Klaviermusik"). I had seen [nettuts](http://net.tutsplus.com "nettuts") tutorial on [creating a slick Flickr gallery with SimplePie](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/php/create-a-slick-flickr-gallery-with-simplepie/ "Create a slick FLickr Gallery with SimplePie").

SimplePie is an RSS feed reader, and the tutorial showed how to incorporate it into your site, along with some [JQuery](http://jquery.com/ "JQuery") JavaScript and the [Thickbox](http://jquery.com/demo/thickbox/ "Thickbox") style sheet, to create a photo gallery. Once I had the gallery working all Sibylle had to do was add or remove photos from a particular set on her [Flickr](http://flickr.com "Flickr") account to alter the pictures on her website. It seemed like a good solution at the time but has proven to be cumbersome in actual use. 

Today, quite by happenstance I observed [Jon Hicks](http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/ "Hicksdesign") ask on [Twitter](http://twitter.com "Twitter") about a "[clean-looking non-Flash way of embedding a Flickr set into a blog post](https://twitter.com/#!/Hicksdesign/status/164379776390402048 "Tweet"). Much to my delight he soon posted the [best response](https://twitter.com/#!/Hicksdesign/status/164384568839901184 "Tweet").

## Flickrshow
[Flickrshow](http://www.flickrshow.co.uk/ "FLickrshow") produces a very elegant slide show using a Flickr set. There's a single JavaScript file to link to (or download and refer to on your own host), and a few lines of script to embed in your site to produce the gallery. Compared the RSS-feed method I had used before Flickrshow is lightweight and dirt-simple to setup and use.

It only took me about 5 minutes to cobble together a new photo gallery page for Sibylle's site use Flickrshow. Sibylle was delighted with the appearance and so this evening I made the switch. You can see it in [action for yourself](http://sibyllekuder.com/photos.php "Photos"). 

Even after all the years I've been online I am still astounded by how quickly and completely a single reference to something can change your life.
