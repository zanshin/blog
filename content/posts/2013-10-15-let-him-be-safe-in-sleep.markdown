Following the death of my father in September we received the many condolences. The poem below was
included in one card and I find in particularly moving and meaningful.

SPELL OF SLEEP
 
Let him be safe in sleep  
As leaves folded together  
As young birds under wings  
As the unopened flower.
 
Let him be hidden in sleep  
As islands under rain,  
As mountains within their clouds,  
As hills in the mantle of dusk.  
 
Let him be free in sleep  
As the flowing tides of the sea,  
As the traveling wind on the moor,  
As the journeying stars in space.  
 
Let him be upheld in sleep  
As a cloud at rest on the air,  
As a sea-wrack under the waves  
When the flowing tide covers all  
And the shellsâ€™ delicate lives  
Open on the sea-floor.  
 
Let him be healed in sleep  
In the quiet waters of the night  
In the mirroring pool of dreams  
Where memory returns in peace,  
Where the troubled spirit grows wise  
And the heart is comforted.
