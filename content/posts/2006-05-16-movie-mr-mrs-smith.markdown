I was pleasantly surprised by how good _<a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0356910/" title="Mr. & Mrs. Smith">Mr. & Mrs. Smith</a>_ was when I first saw it last fall. Over the weekend I picked up a copy to add to my collection and I enjoyed it just as much watching it again last night. It is a very funny movie, with some decent action thrown in for thrills. Being forced to watch Angelina Jolie doesn't hurt either.

Rating: Worthy of a sequel.
