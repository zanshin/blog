For the past month or so I've been reading three books concurrently.  While we were in Germany we picked up a copy of Ken Follet's _Pillars of the Earth_, an epic tale of building a cathedral in 12th century England.  This has become the bathroom book, and we each read a few pages every visit.

My bedroom book, which gets read for a few minutes every evening before going to sleep has been Joseph Heywood's _The Berkut_.  I finished that story two nights ago, so last night I picked up _Fellowship of the Ring_ by J. R. R. Tolkien, to restart the _Lord of The Rings_ again.

And during lunch I've been reading electronic books. Just before leaving for Europe I finished rereading Elizabeth Kostova's _The Historian_, a wickedly good take on the Dracula story.  Since returning I've completed John Katzenbach's _Hart's War_ (far better than the movie), and I've started _The Blue Nowhere_, by Jeffery Deaver.

I'm enjoying each book, and I like having plenty to read.  The only trouble is keeping straight what's happened before when I sit down with a different book.  Fortunately the story lines are all different enough to help keep them separated.  There are very few Hobbits hacking in the blue nowhere, and very few hackers in 12th century England.  I suppose there _could_ be Hobbits in 12th century England, but so far that hasn't been an issue.
