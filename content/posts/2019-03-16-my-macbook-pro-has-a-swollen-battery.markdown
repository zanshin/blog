My late 2013 15" MacBook Pro Retina has a swollen battery. Recently I noticed that the trackpad was
increasingly hard to click. In fact the upper half, the bit closest to the space bar on the
keyboard, can't be clicked at all. When you put the laptop on a flat surface it is starting to rock
from side to side a little now too.

According to my [Battery Health
app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/battery-health-monitor-stats/id490192174 "Battery Health app"), the current maximum charge possible is 7097 mAh out of 8440 mAh
originally. Or 83% of its original capacity. The manufacture date is shown as May 16, 2014, so it is
eight weeks shy of being 5 years old. It has seen 512 cycles. Apple suggests that my laptop battery
has a useful life of 1,000 cycles.

Apple will replace my battery for $199. The nearest Apple store location is 110 miles away. There is
a certified repair center about 15 miles away. Both require that you bring the laptop in for a
diagnostic test first. This is ti "certify" what the issue is, so that genuine Apple OEM parts can
be ordered. I was quoted 24-48 hours for the diagnostic, and 4-5 days for the battery shipment and
replacement.

I have other computers (5 that I can reach from where I am sitting) but I really don't like having
my primary computer out of my hands for 5-7 days, or more.

A couple of searches led me to this YouTube video, which shows [How to Replace a Late 2013 MacBook
Pro Battery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfHHIERH2J0 "Repair: MacBook Pro 15, Late 2013 Battery
Replacement [ENGLISH]"). After watching it a couple times, and after reading about the iFixIt kit
used to make the repair, I wen ahead and ordered a [MacBook Pro 15" Retina (Late 2013-Mid 2014)
Battery](https://www.ifixit.com/Store/Mac/MacBook-Pro-15-Inch-Retina-Late-2013-Mid-2014-Battery/IF117-046?o=5
"MacBook Pro 15" Retina Battery kit"). It should be here in 4 or 5 days.

I'll post again with how the replacement went. Hopefully on this laptop with a new battery, and not
on a hastily purchased new laptop.
