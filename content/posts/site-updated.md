After using Jekyll for years to generate my website, I have switched to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io
"Hugo"). There are a number of reason, which I'll cover in a later posting. I believe most, if not
all, of the features of my site have been successfully converted. (As of 10/30/2022 my image on the
"About" page isn't working.) Poke the email icon in the sidebar to let me know if you find something
that isn't quite right.
