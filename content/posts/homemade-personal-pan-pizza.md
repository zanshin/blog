For the past several months I've been making personal pan pizzas at home. The
recipe I'm using is simple, and the results have been surprisingly good.

## Recipe
(This makes two 8" inch pizzas)

Dough
- 3/8 teaspoon of dry yeast
- 3/4 cup of warm water
- 1 teaspoon Kosher salt
- 7 ounces bread flour
- Olive Oil
- two 8" cast iron skillets
- 8 or 9" cake dish

Topping
- Pizza Quick sauce
- Shredded Mozzarella cheese
- Pepperoni
- Grated Parmesan cheese

Combine the yeast and water, stirring to mix. Ideally this
should sit for 5 minutes before being combined into the flour. I stir the water
a couple times during that wait to make sure all the yeast is dissolved.

Measure 7 oz of bread flour and add the salt. Stir to combine.

Pour the water and yeast mixture into the flour. Stir until just combined. It
should look dry.

I use a 9 inch square Pyrex baking dish for the dough to rise in. Oil the dish
with olive oil. For the cooking step below the oil cannot be Extra Virgin, as
that has a lower smoke point and will burn, so I use regular olive oil
throughout this process.

With the dish lightly oiled, and at least one of your hands oiled as well,
transfer the dough to the dish. Spread it out as evenly as possible. It won't
cover the bottom, but that is okay.

Cover with plastic wrap (puncture the plastic several times with the point of a
knife). Let the dough sit for at least 8 hours. I make mine the night before.

About 2 1/2 hours before mealtime, oil two 8" cast iron skillets, bottom and
sides. Split the dough evenly. Gather half the dough up into a loose ball and
place in the skillet. Pull the sides up and over the top, and then flip the
dough over. Spread it out as much as it will allow. Again, it won't cover the
bottom. Repeat for the other half.

Preheat the over to 350 degrees for 2 or 3 minutes, then turn it off. You want
it warm, not hot. Place the skillets in the oven for the final rise. Loosely 
cover with plastic wrap.

About 30 minutes before mealtime, remove the skillets from the oven. The dough
should have risen and spread out in the skillets. Preheat the oven to 550
degrees or as hot as it will go. Ours tops out at 525.

While the oven is heating, add pizza sauce and your choice of toppings. I put
2, maybe 3, tablespoons of pizza sauce on the dough, spreading it out evenly
from the center, leaving a 1/2 inch or so dough as a border. I use just enough
shredded Mozzarella cheese to cover the sauce. Add pepperoni or other toppings.
Sprinkle a teaspoon or so o grated Parmesan cheese over the top. When the oven 
is ready, bake the pizzas for 15 minutes. 

Remove from the pan (slice if desired) and transfer to plates and enjoy.
