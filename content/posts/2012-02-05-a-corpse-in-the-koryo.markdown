I learned about James Church and his Inspector O novels through [@timbray](https://twitter.com/#!/timbray "Tim Bray") on Twitter. The novels are all set in North Korea and they paint an interesting picture of life there. Just as novels offering a glimpse inside the Soviet Union were fascinating to me before that regime fell, novels about the secretive North Korea are also interesting.
