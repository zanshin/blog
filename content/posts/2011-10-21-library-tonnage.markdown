I like to [read](https://zanshin.net/books "Books"). I read everyday and
I am usually reading more than one book on any given day. Paperback,
hardback, or eBook, mystery, action, suspense, novel, and even the
occasional non-fiction -- all are fair game. In 2010 I kept track of the
titles I read, so I know I completed 85 books that year.

Currently I'm reading two books at home. The first, checked out from the
library a week or so ago is Ken Follett's _Fall of Giants_. It's the
first of a trilogy about World War I.  

The book is lengthy at about 985 pages, and heavy too. My bathroom scale
puts it at an even 3.0 pounds. Laying in bed at night, reading before
turning the light off to sleep is a workout.

The second book I'm reading is one I got at the library last night. It's
Neal Stephenson's _Reamde_.

Since I have all of Stephenson's other books I don't know why I thought
this one would make a better late-at-night-reading-in-bed book, but I
did. At least until I got to the library to check it out. It weighs
2.4 pounds and measures 1024 pages. The .6 pound difference does
make the book noticeable lighter, but the book still gets heavy after a
while.

On our recent trip to Germany I decided not to take any paper books at
all. Instead I relied upon the Kindle app on my iPad for reading. I
consumed the first two George R. R. Martin books from the _Song of Ice
and Fire_ series. 

A total of
about 1800 pages that weight no more than the iPad itself. I find
reading on the iPad to be comfortable and enjoyable. However it isn't
the same has having books. 

There is a certain smell to books, and a pleasing heft in your hand as
you carry one. I like the creak of the binding as you open a new book,
and I delight in finding old receipts or business cards that I used as
bookmarks when I reread a book. 

I will always want real books in my home, both to read and to have and
display. But, late in the evening when I am in bed reading, there are
times when I think eBooks are a better solution, if only to reduce the
chance of hurting myself when I drop a three pound novel on my face.
