After <a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/J2EE/petstore/" title="Web 2.0 Petstore">reading about the Web 2.0 version of Sun's Petstore</a> application, I downloaded it to see for myself. At the end of the software license agreement was this line:
<cite>
You acknowledge that this software is not designed, licensed or
intended for use in the design, construction, operation or maintenance
of any nuclear facility.

Okay. Not a problem.
