Book one of 2013 is one I've had on my shelf for several years but never read. Starting with a large number of facts Christopher Hyde weaves a good story around a possible movie of the execution of the Romanov family. Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction, and when you can blur the lines between the two, you get a good espionage tale.
