Nelson DeMille has long been one of my favorite authors, and _Up Country_ is one of my favorite books by him. The author served in Vietnam and you get the very strong impression that parts of the central character's journey through Vietnam and the memories of the war there are really Nelson DeMille's journey and memories. The story itself is very good, but the verisimilitude added by the author's own experience makes it a very powerful book. 

I am looking forward to a third Paul Brenner book in the future.
