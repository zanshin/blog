We spent the day in the ER yesterday. Surprisingly this was a good thing.

About 3 am Tuesday morning Sibylle was up with a feeling of nausea and some
pain in her upper abdomen. Usually a cap full of Pepto Bismol soothes her
stomach and she is fine. The Pepto didn't work and her pain only got worse. She
was able to vomit at least once, but that also didn't bring any real relief. By
7 am she was feverish, covered in sweat, and in a great deal of pain.
I suggested that we go to the emergency room. After a few moments Sibylle
agreed.

The intake process at the ER was quick and Sibylle was soon in a bed covered
with a heated blanket. The first medicine that was administered was to quell
the nausea, and then she was given a shot of Morphine for the pain. The nausea
subsided fairly quickly but the pain she was experiencing continued. She said
it was up high, just under her sternum, and stretched around her right side,
under her rib cage. There was also a second band of pain low in her abdomen,
behind and below her belly button.

When the Morphine didn't work she was given a dosage of Dilaudid through her
IV. This is a powerful painkiller and it did the trick. I could see the lines
of pain on her face melt away as the drug took hold.

The hospital performed an ultrasound to image her gallbladder and surrounding
area. They had already done some palpitations of her abdomen to make sure it
wasn't her appendix. The results of the ultrasound showed some "sludge" in her
gallbladder, and some dilation of the bile duct and pancreatic duct. Apparently
sludge in the gallbladder isn't unusual or always cause for alarm. The doctor
was more concerned about the duct dilation he was seeing. 

The next step was to perform a CT, or "cat", scan with a contrast agent.
Sibylle was given a cup full of what looked like weak lemonade to drink. She
said it was delicious - of course this was the only fluid she had been allowed
to drink for several hours. During the scan itself she was injected with
another contrast agent through her IV port. 

The results of the CT scan showed that both ducts, the gallbladder and
pancreatic, were within the normal range for size. Also there was no evidence
of injury or disease in the gallbladder. No evidence of gall stones or
thickening of the bladder walls.

The time for the two procedures, and waiting for their results took until early
afternoon. Her nausea was returning, as was the pain. She was given a third
shot of anti-nausea medicine (the second had come with the liquid contrast
agent as it sometimes gives people nausea), and a final dosage of Dilaudid. The
ER attending doctor came in and discussed what they had found, or rather not
found. The good news is that there doesn't appear to be something wrong. The
less good news is that we still aren't sure what is causing her symptoms. 

Our next step is to see our primary care physician and schedule an endoscopy.
Using a scope the doctor can visually see the lining of her stomach and even,
I guess, the upper portion of her intestine. The scope will be combined with
a nuclear agent to allow visibility of the gallbladder and the ducts in
question. 

In the meantime we'll be having blander food, with smaller portions to try and
avoid the miserable experience she had on Tuesday. We have a prescription for
both a painkiller and anti-nausea agent in case her symptoms return.

Going to the ER is not any one's idea of fun, but it was the right thing to do
in this case. The staff there was helpful, concerned, and very good about
taking care of Sibylle. Just knowing that we weren't alone was helpful. And
seeing her relief as the pain medicine did its job was priceless.
