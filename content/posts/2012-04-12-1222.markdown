Ever since Stieg Larsson erupted on to the literary scene there have been any number of Scandinavian authors being translated into English, hoping, I think, to cash in on the "Scandinavian best seller craze". _1222_ by Anne Holt is one of the better ones I've tried. She manages to out Christie Agatha. I'll have to look for others by Holt as I quite enjoyed the central character of Hanne Wilhelmsen.
