I am by no means an Apple pundit, nor I am privy to any inside information. I'm just a long time
Apple fan with a wish list.

## Apple M1 iMac
I think Apple should take the Pro Display XDR chassis and use it as the new form-factor for the iMac
(and its big sister, the iMac Pro). It'd be a sealed enclosure, i.e., not user upgradeable. With at
least 4 USB-C sized ports on the back.

It'll need a stand, probably a fixed stand version of the XDR stand.

## Apple M1 iMac Pro
Same thing as with the iMac, only make a portion of the back hinged to allow access to one or maybe
two expansion slots. Pro users without the means to acquire a Mac Pro, would flock to an iMac Pro
that had an expansion slot or two.

## Apple Retina Display
There's a huge hole in display offerings from Apple. There is one display option that will run you
$6000 for the base model and $7000 for a nano texture display. There is nothing else. The PC market
caters to business buyers (cheap desktop monitors) or to gamers (less cheap, higher DPI (dots per
inch)) offerings. There is only one 3rd party manufacturer making a retina density display - LG.
Compared to Apple's fit and finish standards, the LG is unfortunately lacking.

Apple should make a Retina Display using the XDR chassis, and the 5K screen in the iMacs. Even at 1200
or 1500 dollars, I suspect they'd be back ordered by all the people with shiny new M1 laptops or M1 Mac
Minis.

It would make for a sexy combination with either of the iMacs described above.

Updating the iMac form factor (long over due), and releasing a matching monitor would nicely refresh
Apple's line up, and would provide a monitor worthy of being used with Apple computers.

I would throw money at a Mac Mini and an Apple Retina Display.
