Cancer is in the air it seems.
<ul>
<li class="il">My sister died of leukemia 30 years ago when we were children.</li> <li class="il">My mother has had several bouts of breast cancer ultimately resulting in a radical mastectomy. </li><li class="il">My father produces two to three cancerous moles on his upper back and neck each year. </li><li class="il">My brother's oldest daughter was born with a neuroblastoma, which thanks to the diligence of her pre-natal doctor, was discovered in time to be completely eradicated. </li><li class="il">My 13 year old second cousin has just been diagnosed with a form of lymphoma and is starting chemotherapy. </li><li class="il">My wife is a survivor of breast cancer.</li></ul>

It's in the air we breathe and the water we drink, and the stress we fail to deal honestly gives it birth in our bodies.

I'm just saying.
