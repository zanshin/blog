_The Two Towers_ has always been the hardest of the three _Lord of the Rings_ series to read. It's darker, and with the split story line and new characters, harder to follow. As with _The Fellowship of the Ring_ the movie version of this book is dramatically different. Several of the characters are wholly different between the two tellings. In the movies Frodo is a victum, and Strider is unwilling to accept his fate. In the books Frodo is stronger and wiser and Strider is almost eager for his fate. I am not one to analyze what I read, but it has been fun to see the vast differences between the movie version and the printed version of this tale.

I've linked to the edition I own even though it is currently unavailable for sale. If you want a copy you'll have to select a different edition.
