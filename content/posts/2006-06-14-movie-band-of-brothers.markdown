_<a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0185906/" title="Band of Brothers">Band of Brothers</a>_ is easily one of the most compelling World War II (or any war for that matter) movies I have ever seen. It is an unflinching look at the realities of combat, and the tremendous sacrifice soldiers made when they left America for an unknown future in the European Theater of Operations.

Rating: I will be buying a copy for my collection immediately
