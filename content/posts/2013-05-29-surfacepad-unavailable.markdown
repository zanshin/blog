In February I bought a [TwelveSouth](http://twelvesouth.com "TwelveSouth") [SurfacePad](http://twelvesouth.com/products/surfacepad_iphone/ "SurfacePad for iPhone") for my iPhone 4S. I liked it so much that I [wrote a review](https://zanshin.net/2013/02/26/surfacepad-review/ "SurfacePad Review"). In late March my wife and I upgraded both our phones to the iPhone 5. The day after getting my new phone I went to the TwelveSouth Website planning on ordering an iPhone 5 SurfacePad. 

After selecting the model and color I wanted, I was informed by the site that it was "currently unavailable." I was given an option to sign up to be notified when the product was available; which I took.

Since then I have checked the TwelveSouth site daily — each time being informed that the SurfacePad was "unavailable".

On April 18th I wrote to TwelveSouth asking what the hold up was, and asking if they had any idea when SurfacePads would be for sale again. 

>Dear TwelveSouth,
>
>I purchased a SurfacePad for my iPhone 4S and loved it. The feel of the leather, the way it looked on the phone, the elegance of the whole thing. Then I upgraded to an iPhone 5. And every day for the past month I've checked the TwelveSouth site to see if the Jet Black SurfacePad in the iPhone 5 size is available. And every day for the past month the answer has been no.

>Sad Panda.
>
>I signed up to be notified when the SurfacePad is available again, but I am sorely disappointed that it has been weeks with no word. My poor iPhone is naked and cold and bereft of its leather jacket.
>
>Sincerely hoping you'll respond with a date (Today? Tomorrow?) when I can order my new SurfacePad.

I received a very nice reply saying that they were "experiencing some manufacturing delays". 

>Hi Mark,
>
>Thank you for the nice email, and especially for your previous SurfacePad for iPhone purchase!

>We are experiencing some delays the manufacturing of the SurfacePad for iPhone, and because of the nature of the delays, I'm afraid we aren't able to predict when they will be back in stock.  If you would like us to notify you as soon as they're available again, please sign up by using this link (if you haven't already done so):  https://app.e2ma.net/app2/audience/signup/1731974/1400299/?v=a

>I'm so sorry for the wait, but we're doing our best to make these available again just as quickly as we can.
>
>If you have any further questions, please let me know.

I continued to check the site daily until May 10th, when I again wrote to TwelveSouth asking for an update. 

>Good morning,
>
>Almost two months ago I purchased a new iPhone 5 to replace my iPhone 4S. I had a SurfacePad for the iPhone 4S. It was the perfect folio-style cover for the phone.
>
>Everyday since purchasing my new phone I've been to the TwelveSouth website ready to purchase a new SurfacePad for my iPhone 5. And everyday since purchasing my new phone I've been disappointed. Yes, I've signed up to be notified when availability returns, but, really, two months?
>
>My poor phone is naked and cold and unprotected in any sense. How long does it take to grow new leather and slap your nifty stickum on it and mail it to people? :)
>
>Any idea when this product will be available again? 

Once again I was told that there were "manufacturing delays" and that the nature of the delay meant TwelveSouth was unable to predict when the product would return to availability.

>Hi Mark, and thank you for your inquiry!

On May 20th (now two months after purchasing my iPhone 5) I looked up TwelveSouth on Twitter and tweeted the following:

>Everyday I check TwelveSouth to see if the SurfacePad for iPhone 5 supply issues have been resolved. Everyday I am sad. cc: @andrewbg

Much to my surprise I received a response from @andrewbg asking what model and color I desired. 

>@zanshin What color/size are you looking for?

After replying with that information, he asked that I follow him and send him a direct message. Since sending the direct message on May 21st I have had no contact with TwelveSouth.

As of this evening, May 29th, the Jet Black SurfacePad for iPhone 5 is still unavailable. I've sent a second direct message to @andrewbg.

I'm perfectly willing to pay full price for a SurfacePad for my phone. My review of it still stands — it's the only case I want for my phone. However, I feel like I'm building up a karmic debt by carrying my iPhone around naked. Eventually I'll have to give in and spend my limited iPhone case dollars on some other case.
