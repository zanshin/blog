I bought my first car 32 years ago, and I am buying my 11th car in a few weeks. Here is a list of all the cars I've owned.

1. 1984 Pontiac Fiero 
1. 1987 Honda Prelude
1. 1992 Mazda Navajo
1. 1994 BMW 318i
1. 1992 Lexus ES 300 
1. 1999 Nissan Altima 
1. 2000 Lexus ES 300 
1. 2001 Audi TT Coupe 
1. 2001 Lexus LS 430 
1. 2010 Honda Insight 

Car number 11 will be a 2016 MINI Cooper S in Volcanic Orange with a black roof and mirror caps. The car has been built and is currently be loaded on a ship for transport to the US. The dealer thinks I'll have it by early September.

For completeness sake I've also owned three motorcycles.

1. 1986 Yamaha Riva 180 
1. 1988 Yamaha Radian 600 
1. 1988 Suzuki Katana 1100F
