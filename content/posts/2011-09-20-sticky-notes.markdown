My work desktop is a 27" iMac and it has this nifty wide bezel at the
bottom, perfect for holding a variety of sticky notes. Here are the
contents of the notes currently adorning that bezel.

* `cvs -qn up -d` & `jboss.pl -i ome -a debug` -- Updating CVS checkouts
  and running our local JBoss management script

* `cmd-shift-del` -- This clears Chrome's cache

* `cmd-option-eject` -- This will cause your Mac OS X machine to go to
  sleep. If you require a password when your machine awakens, then this
effectively locks your computer.

* `cmd-shift-eject` -- This blanks the screen on your Mac OS X machine.

* `cmd-shift-.` -- When you have an open/save dialog open, this key
  combination toggles the visibility of hidden files.

* `NIMBY` -- An acronym for "not in my backyard". I have no idea where
  this came from.

* `repo sync -f -j6 -d` -- I believe this is part of the process of
  checking out Android's source.

* "Those that know, do. Those that understand, teach." ~ Aristotle

* `nc -vvv -w 5 <hostname> <port>` -- What to use instead of ping for
  testing connectivity to remote servers. Ping is blocked here.

* `!<term> [tab]` -- Search zsh history. Type "!" followed by any part
  of the command and then press "tab". You can scroll through the
results using the arrow keys.

* `wc -w * | sort | tail -n#` -- Count the words in all the files in the
  current directory, then sort them, and finally display the largest #
of them.

I ought to put all of these in a wiki or Dropbox housed text file, but
it's easier and faster to put them on little bits of yellow paper which
is sticky on one side and glue them (temporarily) to my monitor.
