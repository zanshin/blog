The follow up book to _Monkeewrench_, _<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00080W3K2/sr=8-1/qid=1142253946/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-6049956-8867347?%5Fencoding=UTF8" title="Live Bait">Live Bait</a>_ is just as good and shows that the mother / daughter team known as P. J. Tracy is no fluke. Great characters, good humor, and some nice plot twists combine to make this a great read.

Rating: Don't start it on a work night, you'll be up all night trying to finish it.
