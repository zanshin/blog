For the past three years I have worked 100% remote. In March 2020, at the start of the pandemic, the
entire IT department at the university where I work was sent to work from home. Initially this was
planned to be a short term measure. However, it has become a full time reality for myself and quite
a few of my co-workers.

I am privileged in a number of ways, including with regard to remote work. My profession (system
administration) lends itself to remote work. My home already had a space designated as my office, my
computer room. My team is relatively small (11 people) and a majority wanted to continue remote work
when the university started bringing people back on campus to work.

# Space and Furniture
I am using a 10-foot by 11-foot bedroom as my office. The walls, where they aren't pierced with a
door or windows, are lined with bookcases. The room is light and airy and affords me a good view of
our driveway and the street leading to our home.

In the winter of 1993-1994, with my father's help, I build a wooden teacher's desk out of cherry.
The top is 33 inches deep and 60 inches wide. There are two draw cabinets, one at each end, that
hold all sorts of treasures. The desk is positioned to allow me to see the larger of the two
windows, and to see the doorway to the hall, and the rest of the house.

I also have a small two-foot by four-foot table that is set at a 90Â° angle to the main desk. Its
role in my setup has changed several times.

My office chair is a Herman Miller Aeron chair that I've had for 20 years. It is the most
comfortable chair I've ever had, and was the best $1000 investment I made.

I also have a treadmill desk. It is made by LifeSpan and is purpose built. The desk is height
adjustable (mechanically not electronically) and is about 30 x 40 inches in size. The treadmill
controls are on a small panel at the front edge of the desktop. The treadmill itself is reasonably
quiet, and has a maximum speed of 4 MPH. I've been walking on it since 2014. I am able to walk and
type or use a trackpad at 1.5 MPH, and I try to get at least an hour on it at work everyday.

# Computers
I have two sets of computers: mine and my employers. I have increasingly practiced good hygiene with
regard to not having work things on my personal devices, and not having personal things on work
devices.

My work computer is a M2 14-inch MacBook Pro, with 32 GB of memory, and 1 TB of storage. I have two
27 4K monitors, one for my sitting desk, and one for my treadmill desk. Each desk has an identical
pair of Apple Magic Trackpad and Keyboard. Both desks have a web camera for video meetings. The
sitting desk has a Dell USB dock that has ports for Ethernet, USB-A and USB-C, and HDMI.

At my sitting desk I plug a single cord into the laptop which connects the camera, and the monitor,
as well as providing power for the computer. On the treadmill I have two cords, one for the monitor
and one for the web camera.

Having identical monitors allows me to have the same desktop arrangement at either desk.

## Personal Computers
I have several laptops, a 24-inch M1 iMac,
