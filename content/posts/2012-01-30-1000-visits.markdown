(Warning: Personal site statistics navel gazing ahead.)

My little bitty site continues to grow in popularity. Last week was the first time I had over 1000 visits for the week without some large outside event like a link from [Shawn Blanc](http://shawnblanc.net "Shawn Blanc") or [Reddit](http://reddit.com "Reddit"). The average weekly visit count has been slowly increasing for the past few months and has been hovering just under 1000 for several weeks now. 

The increased number of visits is icing on the cake for me, as having the site and posting to it are essential to me.
