The image seen below is taken from my <a href="http://shortstat.shauninman.com" title="ShortStat">ShortStat</a> page. It is the list of browsers that have visited my humble page in the past two weeks or so. All the browsers version are included here, i.e. each row is a summary row by browser type. The version shown is the highest version seen.

{{ $image := .ResourceGetMatch "browsers.jpg" }}
<img src="{{ $image.RelPermalink }}" alt="browser percentages" >

At least in my little corner of the Internet, Windows IE isn't the powerhouse it once might have been. Firefox is gaining ground, and fast.
