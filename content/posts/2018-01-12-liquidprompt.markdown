For years I've used a home-grown bash prompt. Recently I started having some rendering issues in
tmux where my display would be off by one line. I suspect I had some double width characters in the
prompt that caused tmux, expecially when it was on a remote machine I was ssh'd into, to get
confused.

After hunting around I found [LiquidPrompt](https://github.com/nojhan/liquidprompt). I've been
happily using it on all my machines, macOS and Linux, for several months now.
