It has been over a year since I blew the dust off my resume, so I took an hour or so today and gutted the old one mining the juicier bits for a new and improved view of my professional self.

For the most part I am pleased with the new format and presentation. I'm sure it'll get tweaked a time or two in the next few days. For now however, for your reading pleasure, I present [my resume](http://markhnichols.com "my resume"). 

(The link has been updated to point to my current resume. The 2004 edition no longer exists online.)
