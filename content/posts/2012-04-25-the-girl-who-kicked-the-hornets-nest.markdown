This is the third time I've read the Millennium Trilogy and it was just as good as the first time. It is an absolute shame that Stieg Larsson died just after completing these books. His story telling is unparalleled. These books are compelling, gripping, and ultimately very satisfying. This series is among the very best I have ever read.
