<img src="{{ $image.RelPermalink }}" alt="neverland.jpg" padding="10" align="left" border="0" height="140" width="92" > this afternoon. It was beautiful, magical, and fantastic. At a time when we both needed an escape we found one. The voyage to Neverland was a perfect antidote to our current predicaments, real and imagined. A perfect holiday movie.

Go see it with the one you love.
