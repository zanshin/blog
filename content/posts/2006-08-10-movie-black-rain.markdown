Pete reminded me that _<a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0096933/" title="Black Rain">Black Rain</a>_ had a scene involving kendo in it, so I got it from Netflix and watched it again. The kendo scene is good, but all to brief. The rest of the movie was good, if a bit formulaic.

Rating: Predictable action fare
