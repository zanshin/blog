Today, Michele pointed me to this article about the current situation that exits between the Western world, and the Islamic world. It is very important to read this with an open mind. This is the most coherent and cohesive description of the underpinnings to the attacks against this country, and the gulf of misunderstanding that now prevents us from resolving the situation those attacks created.
