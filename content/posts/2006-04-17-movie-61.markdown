The HBO movie _<a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0250934/" title="61*">61*</a>_ is about the summer of 1961 when Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris chased after Babe Ruth's 60 home run record. Mantle was the favorite while fans and the press considered Maris an interloper. The movie is a wonderful baseball story, especially in light of the questions around drug usage by today's greatest hitters.

If the record set in 1961 had an asterisk behind it for over thirty years, then the records being set today should have at least that much.

Rating: One of the best baseball movies I've seen
