Another late 1980s drama, this time about spies and secret agents. <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0093640/" title="No Way Out">No Way Out</a> has a nice twist to it. I also thought Kevin Costner did a better job of acting in this than in many of his later roles.

Rating: Dated now that the Cold War is over
