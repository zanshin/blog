A few weeks ago I discovered a new site called [Swipe the Linen](http://swipethelinen.tumblr.com/ "Swipe the Linen") where people can submit an image of their iPhone home screen, along with a short write up of the apps they use. The image if my [home screen](http://swipethelinen.tumblr.com/post/18332910768/mark-nichols-home-screen-ive-owned-my-iphone "My iPhone on Swipe the Linen") that I took just three days after getting my iPhone was published today.
