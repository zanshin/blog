As a part of following the Stanford [iPhone Development](http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs193p/cgi-bin/drupal/ "iPhone Development") course I upgraded my XCode installation to the latest version, 4.2.1 (Build 4D502). However after the update I wasn't able to access any of the documentation.

Turns out it isn't automatically downloaded and installed for you. To set it up
do this:

1. Open XCode's preferences.
2. Open the Downloads tab.
3. Select the "Documentation" tab.
4. Click on the "Check and install now" button.
5. (Optionally) Select the "Check for and install updates automatically"
   option.

After the documentation downloads, hold down the option key and single-click
objects, classes, or methods to see popup documentation window, or
option-double-click to open the XCode Organizer Documentation tab, with a full
listing about the selected item.
