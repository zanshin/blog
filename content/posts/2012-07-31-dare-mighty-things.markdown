The landing sequence for getting Curiosity safely onto the surface of Mars is wildly complex and seemingly improbably. Since communication takes 14 minutes one way to reach Earth from Mars, and since the landing sequence is 7 minutes long, by the time we know the landing sequence has started Curiosity will have been safely on Mars for 7 minutes or already destroyed.
