Like most people I suspect, I didn't know the difference between an _acronym_ and an _initialization_ until quite recently.

An <strong>acronym</strong> is a series of letters pronounced as a word. An <strong>initialization</strong> is a series of letters pronounced as individual letters.

For example, ANSI, the American National Standards Institute, is pronounced "an-see." But AARP, the American Association of Retired Persons, is pronounced "aigh-aigh-are-pee."

Now you know.

Floyd Jasinski wrote me and explained that my selection of AARP as the initialization example was
incorrect as it is pronounced as a word, sounding a bit like "harp". He suggests that FCC,
pronounced â€œeff-see-see" would be a better example.
