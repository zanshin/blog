While I have always identified myself as male, I have never identified with the classic male stereotype. Kudos to this teacher for educating young students about gender. As my mother-in-law Virginia used to say, "There are enough ways in the world for everyone to have one of their own." Hopefully, someday, the human race will be mature enough to recognize that each person will express their gender, sexuality, personality, intelligence, physicality, spirituality in their own unique way.
