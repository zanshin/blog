 I recently purchased "Code" by Charles Petzold. The second edition is fantastic. Starting from very
 basic first principles (flash lights) Mr. Petzold builds layer upon layer using Morse code and
 Braille along the way to introduce the concepts at the foundation of how computers function. I
 haven't completed the book yet, but I highly recommend it.
