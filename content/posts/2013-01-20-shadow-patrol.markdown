_Shadow Patrol_ by Alex Berenson is the third book of the year for me. And the first I've read by this author. It centers around a former CIA agent on assignment in Afghanistan. Looking at the flyleaf of the book I discovered a whole series of books preceding it. This one was good enough that I expect to go back and read the ones preceding it to catch up.
