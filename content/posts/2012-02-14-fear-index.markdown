I enjoy a good audio book and _Fear Index_ was very good. It centers around autonomous machine reasoning and a hedge fund algorithm which combine to make a pretty good thriller. In many ways this story reminded me of one I read 30 years ago called _The Adolescence of P1_ which was about a computer AI programmed to be greedy and fearful. Both books work in part because their respective authors are smart enough to not try to explain the intricate details of how AMR or AI might work. Rather they leave that up to the reader's imagination. I highly recommend _Fear Index_. And _The Adolescence of P1_ too, if you can find a copy.
