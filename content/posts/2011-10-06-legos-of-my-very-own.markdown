A few weeks ago I linked to a [Lego kit that produces a replica of the
Frank Lloyd Wright "Robie House"](https://zanshin.net/2011/09/01/wright-robie-house/ "Robie House Lego Kit") in Chicago. The Robie house is a
masterpiece of his prairie style architecture -- a style I have always
found particularly pleasing to the eye. Growing up in Decatur, Illinois there
were three Frank Lloyd Wright houses (or at least houses heavily
inspired by his design ethic), and Springfield, Illinois, where I lived
for nearly two decades, has a prime example of prairie architecture in
the [Dana Thomas house](http://www.dana-thomas.org/ "Dana Thomas
House"), which I have been fortunate enough to have toured.

Growing up I never had a set of Lego blocks to play with, so seeing a
model of one of my favorite house architectures replicated with Legos
was an immediate draw. I posted a link to the model, saying that this
was something I wanted.

My sister-in-law, Vera, saw that posting and made note of it. She came
into a small windfall this week, and used that money to make a gift of
the Robie House kit to me. Knowing full well what a windfall like that
means to her, and realizing that she knew I would like this model, make
this a priceless gift to me.

Vielen Dank, Vera.
