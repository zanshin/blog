I actually started listening to this book on CD but the penultimate disk wouldn't play in any of my available players. I returned the set to the library and checked out the hardback copy to finish the story. This book reminded me a lot of Daniel Silva's Gabriel Allon series. A bit over the top at times but a good listen, er, read. I've now started reading the first book in the series to catch up.
