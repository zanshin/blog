After letting my intention to have a page of my movies, books, and other media diversions languish for a year, I have finally gotten my act together and configured it the way I want. Now I can make entries that will appear on the main page that will also be picked up by the <a href="https://zanshin.net/diversions.php" title="diversions">diversions</a> page. The old system required a double entry and therefore never happened.
