I've been playing the cello for almost 15 years now. It's an entirely acoustic
instrument, but (for me at least) there are several electronic bits that go
along with the cello.

## Tuner
I use the [TonalEnergy](https://www.tonalenergy.com/te-mobile "TonalEnergy") 
tuner app on my iPhone. It's my tuner, my metronome, and a drone generator, all in one.
Since the app keeps the phone on, I keep my phone plugged in while I practice.
This allows me to spot check my intonation or practice with a click without
interrupting my flow very much.

## forScore and iPad Pro
I scan and create PDF copies of all my music. These are imported into
[forScore](http://forscore.co "forScore"). forScore is a PDF viewer that has
been customized for sheet music. You can add finger number, bow directions,
notes, and text quickly and easily. Instead of carrying a bag full of bound
music, I bring an iPad with hundreds of pieces of music.

I'm using a 12.9-inch iPad Pro, which nearly duplicates standard US paper size.
Combined with forScore, it's a perfect digital sheet music library.

## Butterfly Bluetooth Page Turner Pedal
forScore has an incredibly neat feature where you can use facial gestures to
turn the page forward or backward. You can choose between winking, nodding, or
pursing your lips to the left (backward) or right (forward). I'm only able to
wink one eye, so I can't go back a page with winking. The lip pursing or
nodding is too easy to accidentally do, which isn't useful, especially when
performing.

So I bought a [Bluetooth foot pedal](https://amzn.to/3C77DR9 "Butterfly
Bluetooth Foot Pedal"). Two big buttons, one for forward, one for
backward. After only a few days practice, it has become second nature to use.

## Hearing Aids
For several years now I've been wearing some kind of hearing enhancement. About
a year ago I got a pair of [Jabra Enhance](https://www.jabraenhance.com "Jabra
Enhance") hearing aids. These have four different modes: normal, music,
restaurant, and outdoor. On normal mode my cello has an odd echo effect.
Switching to music mode eliminates echo.

## In Practice
When I go to practice or play I first plug in my iPhone and open the
TonalEnergy app. My phone goes into a clamp on a flexible stalk fastened tomy
music stand. Next I flip on the foot pedal, and turn on my iPad Pro and open
forScore. Finally I use the Apple Watch Jabra app to select the music mode for
my hearing aids.

After all of that, I'm ready to play my acoustic instrument.

## NS Design electric cello
For bonus points I also have a [5-string electric cello](https://thinkns.com/instrument/ns-design-electric-cello/ns-design-electric-cello-wav/ "WAV Cello") from NS Design. This gets plugged into a Peavey bass amp. Then everything is electric.
