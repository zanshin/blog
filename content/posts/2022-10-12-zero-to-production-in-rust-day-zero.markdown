I've spent the past two years learning Go language and using it for some of my personal projects.
I'm in the midst of converting this website from using Jekyll to using Hugo, and wrote a conversion
program to port all my postings from the old site to the new in Go. For the last year or so I have
become increasingly aware of the Rust programming language, and I have wanted to learn more about it.

I've just purchased [Zero to Production in Rust](https://www.zero2prod.com "Zero to Production in
Rust") by Luca Palmieri. My goal is to spend some time everyday reading the book, and working
through the code. I plan on capturing my thoughts, successes, setbacks, etc., in daily (near daily)
blog postings.

For added interest, I've decided to see if I can recreate the same application in Go along side the
one the book creates in Rust.

- The Rust repository: [zero2prod](https://github.com/zanshin/zero2prod "Zero to Prod").
- The Go repository: [go2prod](https://github.com/zanshin/go2prod "Go to Prod").
