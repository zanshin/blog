I continue to plow my way through the _Prey_ books by John Sandford. Since the [first installment](https://zanshin.net/2012/06/26/prey-books/ "Prey Books") I've read or listened to 12 more books in the series.

There are only three more titles to go and I'm all caught up. I had managed to read all of these except _Naked Prey_. Somehow I missed this book when it first came out. Since it introduces the character of Letty West it's an important part of the storyline. Even after reading all of the Prey books back to back I still find them compelling. The characters are multidimensional and interesting and their lives move forward and change outside of each book. That there is overlap with two of Sandford's other series, the Kidd books and the Virgil Flowers books, also adds to their pull. Easily one of my favorite authors.
