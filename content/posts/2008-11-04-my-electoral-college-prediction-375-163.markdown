For what it is worth, I predict that Barack Hussein Obama will become the 44th President of the United States of America shortly before midnight (Central Time) with an Electoral College vote of 375-163.

Here's my map:

{{ $image := .ResourceGetMatch "375-163.jpg" }}
<img src="{{ $image.RelPermalink }}" class="aligncenter" title="375 - 163" alt="" width="480" height="350" >
