Some how I had missed this Meg Ryan / Andy Garcia movie about addiction. _<a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0111693/" title="When A Man Loves A Woman">When A Man Loves A Woman</a>_ is an excellent look at the impacts addiction has on a family. What I especially liked was that it showed not only the behaviors of the addict, but the behaviors of the enabler as well.

Rating: Sobering
