A good friend introduced me to <a href="http://www.evanescence.com/" title="Evanescence">Evanescence</a> today. It's the combination of a classically trained pianist and a heavy metal band producing something called "gothic rock." One listen and I was hooked. Their debut album, _<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000089RVX/sr=8-1/qid=1139872899/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-6736304-3080716?%5Fencoding=UTF8" title="Fallen">Fallen</a>_ is available on Amazon.
