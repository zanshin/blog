Forget running Mac OS X on any old Intel processor. I managed to sneak into Apple's R&amp;D Lab and make off with a soon to be released G5 Powerbook!

See:

Actually I followed <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20050809204632497" title="Easily Change Mac OS X CPU Type">this</a> Mac OS X Hint.

Kinda makes you wonder about the veracity of all these Mac OS X running on x86 machines, doesn't it.
