My current car, a 2001 Lexus LS 430, just crossed the hundred thousand mile mark. Purchased used three years ago last month, it had a mere twenty-seven thousand miles when I started driving it. That's an average of nineteen hundred miles a month, give or take.

At this rate I should see two hundred thousand in about four years.

(Yes. The pictures were taken while driving.)
