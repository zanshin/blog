My experiment to try mutt for thirty days is over today. After ten days I realize that I enjoy
tinkering with mutt more than I enjoy using it as my primary email client. Consequently, I'll be
switching to a different email client for the next ten days.

## What Works About Mutt

* It is hugely customizable.
* There is a vibrant community devoted to it.
* Through ssh and tmux, it is possible to access it from any computer.
* Encryption is a first-class citizen.


## What Doesn't Work About Mutt

* While you can run a terminal emulator on your smart phone, you will most likely *not* use mutt for
  mail on the go.
* HTML email is everywhere. Viewing it in w3m of Lynx is less than satisfactory.
* Even with urlview, deciphering a list of URLs embedded in an email to find the one you want is
  cumbersome.
* The burden of mapping an account and its mail boxes is on you.
* There is no built in junk mail filtering. I ran SpamSieve in another client to prevent mutt from
  being cluttered up.

## Conclusion
I'll continue to maintain my mutt setup. When I'm using my Linux laptop, which has only the Sway
Window Manager, and I need email, I connect to my local server and access mutt. I guess mutt is
a reserve email solution. Nice to have, enjoyable to tinker with, can be used in a pinch, but not
what you want for day-to-day use.
