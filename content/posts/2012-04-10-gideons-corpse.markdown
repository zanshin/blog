Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child's latest Gideon Crew novel, _Gideon's Corpse_, is good pulp fiction but not a terribly deep story. Like too many action movies this story jumps from one implausible episode to another. I suspect that there are publisher deadlines in the background requiring a new Preston/Child novel on a regular schedule. Books like _Gideon's Corpse_ are the result of trying to fit creative work into a set schedule.
