It seems with all the fuss over _<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385504209/qid=1148229219/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/103-3758824-1025434?s=books&v=glance&n=283155" title="The da Vinci Code">The da Vinci Code</a>_ there are a slew of grail related books in the stores. _<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0525949410/sr=8-1/qid=1148229124/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-3758824-1025434?%5Fencoding=UTF8" title="The Last Templar">The Last Templar</a>_ is yet another take on the possible meaning of the grail, or at least the foundations of modern Christian theism. Not as polished as _<a href="http://www.zanshin.net/blogs/000889.html" title="Labyrinth">Labyrinth</a>_, and no where near as good as Dan Brown's epic, but still and enjoyable read.

Rating: Don't expect to see this in the theaters any time soon
