This is truly amazing. Using the sensors built-in to the Apple Watch, in conjunction with an iPhone
running NightWare, a person's nightmares can be detected and interrupted, without interrupting the
persons sleep. Aimed primarily at veterans with PTSD today; I hope it becomes widely available to
everyone soon.
